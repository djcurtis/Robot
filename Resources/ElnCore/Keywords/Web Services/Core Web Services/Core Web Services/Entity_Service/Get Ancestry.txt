Documentation     The following test cases are all for the endpoint: GET /services/1.0/entities/{entityId}/ancestry
...
...               It gets the ids of the ancestors of the given entity. The order of the ids returned will be such that the first element of the array is the most distant ancestor, and subsequently in order of ancestry up to the last element, which will be id of the given entity. As there can be more than one root element defined in the hierarchy (Root, My Work), the first element of the array is determined by the tree brunch the queried entity belongs to.
