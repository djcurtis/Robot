*** Test Cases ***
Get attributes
    [Documentation]    
    ...
    ...    A successful call returns the HTTP status 200 and an instance of SAPIAttributeSequence
    ${experiment_name}=    Set Variable    GAT-S001
    ${experiment_id}=    Create Experiment    ${project_id}    ${experiment_name}
    ${experiment_version_id}=    Get Entity Version ID    ${experiment_id}
    ${sapi_attribute_sequence}=    Get Attributes    ${experiment_id}    ${experiment_version_id}
    # Checking expectations
    Should Contain    ${sapi_attribute_sequence}    GAT-S001

Get attributes with missing entity version id
    [Documentation]    
    ...
    ...    If the call parameter ‘entityVersionId’ is missing, then the HTTP status code 200 is returned to the client. If ‘entityVersionId’is invalid, then the HTTP status code 400 is returned to the client
    ${experiment_name}=    Set Variable    GAT-S002
    ${experiment_id}=    Create Experiment    ${project_id}    ${experiment_name}
    # missing entity version id
    ${attributes}=    Get Attributes    ${experiment_id}    ${EMPTY}    200
    # wrong entity version id
    ${attributes}=    Get Attributes    ${experiment_id}    WrongEntityVersionId    404

Get attributes with not existing entity
    [Documentation]    
    ...
    ...    If the entity does not exist, then the HTTP status code 404 is returned to the client
    ${experiment_name}=    Set Variable    GAT-S003
    ${experiment_id}=    Create Experiment    ${project_id}    ${experiment_name}
    ${experiment_version_id}=    Get Entity Version ID    ${experiment_id}
    ${attributes}=    Get Attributes    WrongId    WrongVersionId    404

Get attributes without permissions
    [Documentation]    
    ...
    ...    A client requires the OPEN_< ENTITY_TYPE> permission. If it does not have it, then the HTTP status code 403 is returned to the client
    ${experiment_name}=    Set Variable    GAT-S004
    ${experiment_id}=    Create Experiment    ${project_id}    ${experiment_name}
    ${experiment_version_id}=    Get Entity Version ID    ${experiment_id}
    Use User With Permissions    ${username}    ${password}    ${experiment_id}
    ${attributes}=    Get Attributes    ${experiment_id}    ${experiment_version_id}    403
