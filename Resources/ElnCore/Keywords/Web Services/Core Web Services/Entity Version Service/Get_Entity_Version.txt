*** Test Cases ***
Check Can Get Entity Versions
    [Documentation]    A successful call returns the HTTP status 200 and an instance of SAPIEntityVersionInfoSequence
    ...
    ...    The 'create versioned experiment' should create 4 versions.
    ...    There are no apparent guarantees on the returned order of the versions, so a simple check is done to ensure each version is within the expected version list (1-4)
    ${experiment_name}=    Set Variable    GEV-S001
    ${experiment_id}=    Create Versioned Experiment    ${experiment_name}
    ${version_info}=    Get Entity Versions    ${experiment_id}
    ${expected_versions}=    Create List    1    2    3    4
    ${json_value}=    Get Json Value    ${version_info}    /version/0
    Log    ${json_value}    INFO
    ${version_number}=    Get Json Value    ${json_value}    /versionNumber
    Should Contain    ${expected_versions}    ${version_number}
    ${json_value}=    Get Json Value    ${version_info}    /version/3
    Log    ${json_value}    INFO
    ${version_number}=    Get Json Value    ${json_value}    /versionNumber
    Should Contain    ${expected_versions}    ${version_number}

Check GET Entity Versions Fails With Bad Id
    [Documentation]    If the entity does not exist, then the HTTP status code 404 is returned to the client
    ${experiment_id}=    Set Variable    GEV-S002
    ${version_info}=    Get Entity Versions    ${experiment_id}    404

Check GET Entity Versions Fails Without VIEW_HISTORY permission
    [Documentation]    A client requires the VIEW_HISTORY_<CONTAINER_ENTITY_TYPE> permission. If it does not have it, then the HTTP status code 403 is returned to the client
    ${name}=    Set Variable    CUSTOM_GEV-S003
    ${experiment_id}=    Create Versioned Experiment    GEV-S003
    ${entity_version_id}=    Get Entity Version ID    ${experiment_id}
    ${role_name}=    Create Custom EVS Role    ${name}
    ${remove_permission}=    Remove Role Permission    ${role_name}    VIEW_HISTORY_EXPERIMENT
    ${response}=    Assign User Entity Role    ${username}    ${role_name}    ${experiment_id}
    ${old services username}=    Set Variable    ${SERVICES USERNAME}
    ${old services password}=    Set Variable    ${SERVICES PASSWORD}
    ${SERVICES USERNAME}=    Set Variable    ${username}
    ${SERVICES PASSWORD}=    Set Variable    ${password}
    Log    Switching default user...    INFO
    ${version_info}=    Get Entity Versions    ${experiment_id}    403
    ${SERVICES USERNAME}=    Set Variable    ${old services username}
    ${SERVICES PASSWORD}=    Set Variable    ${old services password}
    ${unassign_role}=    Delete User Entity Role    ${username}    ${role_name}    ${experiment_id}
    ${tidy_up}=    Delete Custom EVS Role    ${role_name}
