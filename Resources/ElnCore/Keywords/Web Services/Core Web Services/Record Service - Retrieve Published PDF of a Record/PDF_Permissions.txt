...               ENDPOINT: /services/1.0/records/{entityId}/publish
...
...               The tests in this suite check that the correct response is returned depending on whether user has the relevant permissions for retrieving the published PDF for a record using the above endpoint. \ The test suite covers the following scenarios:
...
...               1. User with All_entity_permission roles, but applied at a specific entity level.
...               Test where user has / has not got access to enttiies
...
...               2. \ User with PDF Test role applied at /Root/
...               Test roles with various combinations of PDF related permissions

01 Entity Access
    [Documentation]    *Endpoint: _/services/1.0/records/{enitytID}/publish/pdf_ - Check Entity Access*
    ...
    ...    Test checks that when a user performs a GET request in order to retrieve the PDF of a published record:
    ...
    ...    - \ HTTP status 200 is returned: \ when user has access to the record entity
    ...    - \ HTTP status 403 \ is returned: when user has NO access to the record entity
    ...
    ...    *Data Setup*
    ...    - There are 2 projects *Has Access* and *NO Access* which contain published experiment PDFs
