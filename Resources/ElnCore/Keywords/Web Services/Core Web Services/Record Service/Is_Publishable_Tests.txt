*** Test Cases ***
Check Whether the User Can Publish a Record
    [Documentation]    A successful call returns the HTTP status 200 and an instance of SAPIBooleanResponse.
    ...
    ...    The record needs to be locked, so this test asserts that a record is publishable (true) when it is locked and is not publishable (false) when it is unlocked
    ${experiment_name}=    Set Variable    IPU-S001
    ${experiment_id}=    Create Publishable Experiment    ${experiment_name}    ${project_id}
    ${lock_response}=    EntityAPILibrary.Lock Entity    ${experiment_id}
    ${response}=    Is Record Publishable    ${experiment_id}
    Response Body Should Contain    true
    ${lock_response}=    EntityAPILibrary.Unlock Entity    ${experiment_id}
    ${response}=    Is Record Publishable    ${experiment_id}
    Response Body Should Contain    false

Check Publishing a Record Fails for Bad Id
    [Documentation]    If the entity does not exist, then the HTTP status code 404 is returned to the client
    ${bad_id}=    Set Variable    IPU-S002
    ${response}=    Is Record Publishable    ${bad_id}    404
    Response Body Should Contain    Resource not found for given ID: Requested entity does not exist
