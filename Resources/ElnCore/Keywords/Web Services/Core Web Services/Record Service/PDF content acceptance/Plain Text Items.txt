Wide and Long Plain Text Portrait A4
    [Documentation]    This test looks at inserting two plain text items that are designed to be larger than the page. \ It has been found during manual testing that when testing these in isolation defects are missed, therefore it's also seen as important to cover these kind of combination scenarios. \ Each of the text items in this test are one for each of:
    ...
    ...    - Wider than the page
    ...
    ...    - Longer than the page
