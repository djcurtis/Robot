Defect - final line orphaned (visual representation)
    [Setup]    Setup Just Signatures Empty Test Case
    comment    The issue was the text right at the end of the pdf signature swould be orphaned when the page break was between the last signature and this text ("Visual representation of digital signature. Original on File")    So this test puts the signature right at the end so that the page would break here, using an image of the correct size in the item before. The size of the image was determined by trial and error. 657px high stayed on same page, 660px high is all moves to next page (as we want) - so 660px is the value used, and would lead to the text being orphaned if the defect regressed
