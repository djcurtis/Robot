Analytic data
    [Documentation]    Creates an experiment containing a ANALITICDATA, publishes it and check the created PDF with the curated one. \ It should be noted that the 'data' colum contains invalid data but for the purposes of PDF generation that is fine. Just do not expect to see things turning up in the thick client experiment preview. The spectra (and sequence) type is an internal type which SAPI does not support for load currently.
