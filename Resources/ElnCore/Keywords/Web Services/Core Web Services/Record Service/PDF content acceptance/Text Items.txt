Wide and Long Text
    [Documentation]    This test looks at inserting two text items that are designed to be larger than the page. \ It has been found during manual testing that when testing these in isolation defects are missed, therefore it's also seen as important to cover these kind of combination scenarios. \ Each of the text items in this test are one for each of:
    ...
    ...    - Wider than the page
    ...
    ...    - Longer than the page

Formatted Text
    [Documentation]    This test looks at inserting a text item into the experiment whcih has different formatted text within it to cover looking at some of the potential settings which can be applied.

Wide and Long Tables
    [Documentation]    This test looks at imputting simple tables into text items. \ These tables do however each have one of the following properties:
    ...    - 1 is wider than a page
    ...    - 1 is longer than a page

Large Embedded Images
    [Documentation]    This test looks at creating text items and inserting an image into each. \ The images being used both require scaling as they're too big for the page otherwise.
