*** Test Cases ***
Check can get system setting for specific key
    [Documentation]    A successful call returns the HTTP status 200 and an instance of SAPISettingValueList
    ${key}=    Set Variable    InforSense.host
    ${system_setting}=    Get System Setting    ${key}    STRING
    Check Xml Element Value Equals    check that the Inforsense host is set to localhost    ${system_setting}    localhost    value    elementNamespace=http://settings.services.ewb.idbs.com

Get system setting fails for invalid data type
    [Documentation]    If the value supplied for the parameter ‘type’ is not with the ones defined by SAPISettingsDataType, then the HTTP status code 404 is returned to the client.
    ...
    ...    valid types are:
    ...
    ...    AUTO_ID
    ...    BINARY
    ...    BOOLEAN
    ...    CHEMISTRY
    ...    IMAGE
    ...    INTEGER
    ...    NUMBER
    ...    STRING
    ...    TIMESTAMP
    ${key}=    Set Variable    InforSense.host
    ${system_setting}=    Get System Setting    ${key}    BOOLEAN
    Check Xml Does Not Contain Element    check that there are no values set    ${system_setting}    value    elementNamespace=http://settings.services.ewb.idbs.com

Check can get system setting with default data type
    [Documentation]    If parameter ‘type’ is not supplied, its default value (STRING) is used. Hence, the value of returned setting data type is STRING.
    ...
    ...    So here, the port (number) is returned as the string '11008' as opposed to a numeric representation of '11,008'
    ${key}=    Set Variable    InforSense.port
    ${system_setting}=    Get System Setting    ${key}    NUMBER
    Check Xml Element Value Equals    check that the Inforsense host is set to localhost    ${system_setting}    11,008    value    elementNamespace=http://settings.services.ewb.idbs.com
    Check Xml Element Value Equals    check that the Inforsense host is set to localhost    ${system_setting}    NUMBER    dataType    elementNamespace=http://settings.services.ewb.idbs.com

Check get system setting fails with unencoded key
    [Documentation]    The value of parameter ‘key’ must comply with HTML URL Encoding. For instance the symbol ‘/’ forward slash must be escaped as ‘%2F’ and the symbol ‘\’ back slash must be escaped as %5C. If the encoding is incorrect, then the HTTP status code 404 is returned to the client.
    ${key}=    Set Variable    Stoichiometry Configuration/gramsUnit
    ${system_setting}=    Get System Setting    ${key}    STRING    404

Check can get system setting with encoded key
    [Documentation]    The value of parameter ‘key’ must comply with HTML URL Encoding. For instance the symbol ‘/’ forward slash must be escaped as ‘%2F’ and the symbol ‘\’ back slash must be escaped as %5C. If the encoding is incorrect, then the HTTP status code 404 is returned to the client.
    ${key}=    Set Variable    Stoichiometry%20Configuration%252fgramsUnit
    ${system_setting}=    Get System Setting    ${key}    STRING
    Check Xml Element Value Equals    check that the Inforsense host is set to localhost    ${system_setting}    g    value    elementNamespace=http://settings.services.ewb.idbs.com

Check can get system setting fails with incorrect encoded key
    [Documentation]    The value of parameter ‘key’ must comply with HTML URL Encoding. For instance the symbol ‘/’ forward slash must be escaped as ‘%2F’ and the symbol ‘\’ back slash must be escaped as %5C. If the encoding is incorrect, then the HTTP status code 404 is returned to the client.
