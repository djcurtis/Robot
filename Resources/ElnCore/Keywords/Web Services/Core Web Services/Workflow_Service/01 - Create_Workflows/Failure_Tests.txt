Documentation     Covering the */services/1.0/workflows* endpoint
...
...               *NOTE* Due to the nature of the way workflow configuration validation is performed on the server there is *NO* way of determining why a configuration couldn't be applied to an entity via the REST interface, thus some of these tests could be failing for the *WRONG* reason ! This makes these tests inherently fragile, however this is mitigated by the fact that we do have a fairly comprehensive set of unit tests that are performing virtually the same tests as these. Hopefully the two sets of tests will be enough to ensure good code/API coverage.
