Documentation     This test will test the functionality of the entity permissions 'CANCEL_ANY_WORKFLOW' and will be split into a positive and negative test. The positive test will check that a user un-associated with a task (not the requestor or the actioner/reviewer), with the entity permission CANCEL_ANY_TASK *is* able to cancel the relevant task. The negative test will check that a user un-associated with a task without the entity permissions CANCEL_ANY_TASK is *not* able to cancel the relevant task.
