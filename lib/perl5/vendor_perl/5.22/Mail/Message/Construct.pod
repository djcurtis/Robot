=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item $obj-E<gt>B<AUTOLOAD>()

When an unknown method is called on this message, this may mean that
not all code is compiled.  For performance reasons, most of the
complex activities on messages are dynamically loaded from other
packages.  An error will be produced when loading does not help resolving
the requested method.
